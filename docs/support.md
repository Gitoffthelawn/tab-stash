# Help! What do I do?

## I Have a Problem

First off, I'm sorry to hear that! Here are a few things to try, in order from
easy to hard:

1. If the problem is with the sidebar or stash list, close and open the sidebar
   (or Tab Stash tab). This often resolves temporary UI issues and glitches.
2. Check the [list of extensions that are known to have problems working with
   Tab Stash](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/wiki/Known-Incompatibilities-with-Other-Extensions)
   to make sure the issue is not caused by another extension.
3. Restart your browser.
4. Restart your browser, discarding any saved session data.
   ([Here's how.](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/wiki/Restart-Firefox-Without-Saved-Session-Data))
5. Make sure your Firefox is up to date.
   ([Here's how.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/update-firefox-latest-release?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=update-firefox-latest-version))
6. Make sure your Tab Stash is up to date.
   ([Here's how.](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-update-add-ons))

If none of the above helps, or if your problem keeps recurring, you have a couple options:

1. [Search GitHub](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue)
   to see if someone else has run into your problem, and if it's been solved
   already. The most
   [frequently-asked questions](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/issues?q=label%3AA-FAQ)
   are tagged so they can be found easily.
2. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/issues/new/choose)
   on GitHub. While I can't promise to get to your issue in any particular
   timeframe, I do my best to respond quickly, especially for issues which look
   like they may be more serious.

If you're technically savvy and you'd like to try troubleshooting the issue
further on your own,
[here's how to collect error logs](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/wiki/Collect-Error-Logs).
Depending on the problem, including error logs with your report may help solve
it more quickly.

## I Have a Suggestion

I love to hear your suggestions because it helps me decide what to work on next!
Before you submit a new suggestion, please make sure someone else hasn't
submitted it already by
[checking GitHub](https://github.com/josh-berry/tab-stash/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Ai-enhancement+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc).

If your idea is already filed as an issue, feel free to participate in the
discussion, and **be sure to up-vote it** by leaving a thumbs-up reaction on the
_original post_ in the issue. (Leaving a reaction on a comment doesn't count.)
When I'm planning future releases, I look at which issues have seen the most
up-votes to help me learn what people are most interested in.
